# Hospital-Patient-Records-Analysis
Technologies Used: SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook

### Project Overview
This project involved cleaning and analyzing a messy dataset containing hospital patient records. The goal was to standardize and structure the data using SQL and Python, extract key insights, and provide visual reports to support hospital decision-making.

### Key Steps & Achievements
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning (SQL & Python)

Removed duplicate records and standardized inconsistent text formatting.
Converted mixed data types (e.g., age stored as text) into numerical formats.
Standardized date formats for accurate time-based analysis.
Handled missing values by replacing them with appropriate defaults.
ðŸ”¹ Data Exploration & Analysis

Used SQL queries to identify trends, such as the most common diagnoses and busiest hospital departments.
Aggregated patient data to analyze admissions, discharges, and department load.
Identified top-performing doctors based on patient volume.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization & Reporting

Bar Charts to show the number of patients per department.
Pie Charts illustrating patient status distribution.
Line Graphs to track hospital admission trends over time.
Generated a detailed PDF report summarizing insights and recommendations for hospital management.
Key Outcomes
ðŸ“Š Optimized patient data structure for better hospital record management.
ðŸ“ˆ Identified areas where hospital resources need adjustment.
âœ… Provided actionable insights using SQL queries and Python visualizations.
